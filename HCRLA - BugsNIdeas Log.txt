[X] 1# Remove escape characters from the lines of the version log when decoding (particulary remove: /n /t /a /f /r).

[X] 2# After data is saved, set all 'Previous Version' variables to match the current saved version, so that it is not resaving the same data and overwriting a valid file save backup.

[X] 3# When a log file's contents are being displayed, the section tags must be detected only by starting with '[' and ending with ']', not by containing both.

[X] 4# ResLib.Integrate(); when searching through loose contents for matching contents, remove data ID suffixes that are symbols before attempting to match

[X] 5# ResLib.Integrate() -> LegDat.AddKeyDef(); when matching against definitions of Legend Datas, compare at lowercase to avoid case-insensitive duplicates.

[X] 6# @Log Legend View Page, highlight must only be highlighting the legend key. The 'key' within its definitions must not be highlighted.

[X] 7# A non-wordy data ID must be identified as a key that at least contains numbers and letters, and ends with a number. 
    >> Real Testing Examples (NPC_12, NPC_12_Alt_1, Player_0_0, Player_0_1, Tiles_2_Beach, Tiles_59_2, Tiles_199-gross, Tree_Branches_13, Wires2, Wraith_Eyes) 
    >> Possible Resolve: when given a legend key and its definition, only replace the key at the front of the ID with its definition, and leave the rest of the ID as is (example, Item_23 is 'i23', Tiles_42-small is 't42-small')

[X] 8# Gen Steam Log Page -> Submit version log ContentAdditionals should also deliver their related content name from parent ConBase. The only nullable value going into the library reference instance should be the 'optionalName' property of 'Addit' array.

[X] 9# The value '#' as a argument to a table data element is ignored and does not print. It should be invalidated as a value for table header/data elements as the proper usage of '#' is only as plain text.

[X] 10# Gen Steam Log Page -> Formatter Parser: Comparisons against escape characters may not work. If any value returned contains an escape character, that character must be appropriately replaced with the escape characte code (&00; for '"', &01; for '#')

[X] 11# Content Integrity: Verify Content Integrity -> Displays contents as being 100% verified even though 1 content item is confirmed missing (should always be max of 99.9% if ANY items are missing)

[X] 12# Content Integrity: Verify Content Integrity -> Folder editing is very unclear; what to enter and what it will do is a mystery to the user

[X] 13# LibrarySearch.HighlightSearchArg -> Rebuild algorithm to sift through each character and build the 'matching text' without fail. There too many unpredictable variations to be place in switch-cases alone

[X] 1# Updated entries were discarded when integrating version log. Entries in question were overhauled updates. Log version: v1.38. Pls Fix.

[X] 2# Bug report and idea suggestion print out is repeating. Best guess is because the new submission aren't considered 'old' the first time the report is saved.

---------------------
[X] 1# A bug report/idea suggestion route that is accessible from any style input by using a keyphrase (Suggest '@dbi'). Ideas and bugs are saved in a separate file; Ideas & bugs may also be stored with main file data.

[X] 2# Display what base contents the loose contents were connected to after contents have been integrated after a submission. Any mistakes can be undone from a reversion.

[X] 3# Log Legend View should also show from which log version the library's contents are based

[X] 4# Each category within 'Settings->ConInt->ViewAllDataIDs' should show how many Data IDs they contain

[X] 5# The Miscellaneous category within 'Settings->ConInt->ViewAllDataIDs' can seperate its IDs into alphanumeric groups when there are many of them. Ex, A-M group and N-Z group.

[X] 6# Fuse Legend View and Summary View pages into one ('Log Legends and Summaries').

[.] 7# When displaying the decoded version logs, if there is a decode issue, the text may also display or highlight where the error occured when possible (highlight or note where in the text the issue occured).

[X] 8# Within Log Submission Page, encoding save data can be triggered once the main submission page is being exited, rather than after each submitted version log. This allows a proper [file] reversion of log 'session' and greatly decreases any bloating of the Dbug session flush file.

[.] 9# Reversion; Version Reversion, specific version removal is possible, however only if the version's contents is not referenced in future version (Either allowed or denied reversion thereafter; Generally useful only the case of overwriting a log version's info)
    
    [ ] alt.9# Log Submission; If a Version Log is submitted containing version information that already exists within the library, the option to overwrite the pre-existing information may be available (must include an extensive report on the results of overwriting previous information) 

[X] 10# Using a certain syntax to substitute a keycode with symbols that are used for log decoding (example: using "&00" to sub for "-", or using "&04" to sub for "("). File encoding/decoding won't be affected and the data remains true to it's name as it bypasses the possible errors from log decoding.

[.] 11# The option to restart the program on command (either in Main Menu or Settings Menu).

[X] 12# Version reversion may only allow the ability to clear the library's data if only one version's data exists (instead of shunning the user to add more data).

[X] 13# Content Validator's 'Folder Paths' parameter could also allow enabling/disabling a certain folder path during the CIV process. A much better approach than to keep adding and removing folder paths for each CIV process.

[X] 14# An extra syntax change for 'Updated' section that allows self-updating for entries that need to be updated to content that has been added in the same version.

[.] 15# SFormatterLibRef: initialization could condense data ID strings using Extensions.CreateNumericDataIDRanges() method. Alternatively, a new property for library references ('condensedIds' or 'rangeIds') could be introduced for specifically condensed data ID strings

[ ] 16# Allow the Content Integrity Verification system to have a secondary actionable: Moving contents from one folder to another (requires double confirmation). Useful for setting up the XNB workstation. 

    [ ] 16a# Perhaps make this its own thing; relocater or sorter, idk. The files could be fetched after a CIV process and sent to this object. Whatever it may be it should be a settings thing...

[X] 17# PROGRESS BAR! Create a progress bar function for all processes and display this progress to user. Especially helpful where processes can take more than a second (Ex, CIV process).

[ ] 18# File chooser sub-page. When the user is prompeted to select a file or folder open a removable sub-page which allows the user to select the desired file or folder the prompt requests. This sub-page could be opened with a prompt (suggest '@browse'), giving way to manually entering a folder or file path alternatively.
