0# [ ]
Project is using .NET 5.0 (unsupported) with ConsoleFormat class library.
	- Planned to create project using compatible version with ConsoleFormat class (.NET 2.1).
	+ Decided to stick with .NET 5.0 for QoL programming syntax and leave incompatiblity issues up to frequent builds and tests.

1# [ ] 
Implemented base class for data-handling classes (DataHandlerBase.cs).
	- Assumed that each class will handle their own data and write to file.
	+ Assists in communication between data-handling classes, handles some repeating elements, and simplifies mono-file management.

2# [ ]
Added a ninth Foreground Element Color to Preferences for the user's input color.
	- There originally were only eight colors, neither denoted for the user's input.
	+ Just an extra customization option for Foreground elements. Changes also made to Visual customization example for Foreground Element Colors (minor additions).

3# [ ]
Changed the percentages on the first two options for both Height and Width window dimensions.
	- The orignal percentages for the Height and Width window dimensions were 20% and 40%. 20% is way too small for the program to operate.
	+ The original 20% will be changed to 40%, and the original 40% changed to 50%. Both are changes to accomadate for program window operation requirements.
