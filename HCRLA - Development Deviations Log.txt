##	DEVELOPMENT DEVIATIONS LOG	##
==================================
Syntax:		{Num}# {DeviationStatus} 
			{DeviationDescription}
	{Num}
		A incrementing whole number starting from zero that denotes the order in which the deviations were made.
	{DeviationStatus}
		Uses square brackets separated with a space. Use a space character (' ') within brackets if deviation is implemented in development, and an 'X' if the deviation reverted to the original plan.
	{Deviation Description}
		A description of the deviation made. It must include the reason for deviation, what it is deviating from (reference the original plan), and what the deviation is.
		Format
			{DeviationDesc}				<- What the deviation is / cause of deviation (describe)
				- {OriginalPlan}		<- Deviating from what? Original goal
				+ {DeviationPlan}		<- Goal of the deviation
	Ex.
		0# [ ] 
		Spilled paint on the computer.

Logs Below
===============
0# [ ]
Project is using .NET 5.0 (unsupported) with ConsoleFormat class library.
	- Planned to create project using compatible version with ConsoleFormat class (.NET 2.1).
	+ Decided to stick with .NET 5.0 for QoL programming syntax and leave incompatiblity issues up to frequent builds and tests.

1# [ ] 
Implemented base class for data-handling classes (DataHandlerBase.cs).
	- Assumed that each class will handle their own data and write to file.
	+ Assists in communication between data-handling classes, handles some repeating elements, and simplifies mono-file management.

2# [ ]
Added a ninth Foreground Element Color to Preferences for the user's input color.
	- There originally were only eight colors, neither denoted for the user's input.
	+ Just an extra customization option for Foreground elements. Changes also made to Visual customization example for Foreground Element Colors (minor additions).

3# [ ]
Changed the percentages on the first two options for both Height and Width window dimensions.
	- The orignal percentages for the Height and Width window dimensions were 20% and 40%. 20% is way too small for the program to operate.
	+ The original 20% will be changed to 40%, and the original 40% changed to 50%. Both are changes to accomadate for program window operation requirements.

4# [ ]
Changed the seperating character from asterik (*) to percentage (%).
	- The original separator character overlooked the fact that the Legend and some Data IDs will contain the '*' as a key.
	+ The % character will replace the * character in file interactions. Additionally, this character is forbidden by the HCAutoLogger.

5# [ ]
Prospects of integrating an Auto Logger within the HCRLA program lead to a revision of version log syntaxes, this included log commenting which now has new implementations.
	- The version log only supported commenting (or omissions) through using the '--' key.
	+ Multiple omissions or multi-line commenting is now available, using the tags '-- !open --' and '-- !close --'.

6# [ ]
Changed the syntax of the version log SUMMARY as the prospect of integrating an Auto Logger into the HCRLA program is realized.
	- The old syntax would separate multiple Summary parts with '//', while within the tag header, all upon a single line.
	+ Summary has a more uniform and cleaner syntax which occupies multiple lines and is not preceded with the omission key '--'.

7# [ ]
Changed the file encoding syntax of Content Changes group due to decoding issues.
	- The previous syntax was very similar to that of Content Additionals. A problem in decoding as the ConChanges info would become a ConAddits where there was none.
	+ Content Changes information lines start with '^'.

8# [ ]
The encoding syntax for the Legend Data object has been changed from from '{key}*{keyname}***' to '{key}*{verIntro}*{keynames}'.
	- Legend Data's previous syntax followed the idea that it was an unnecessary attribute to keep track of its version.
	+ Due to the idea of version reversion, Legend Data requires a record of when it was introduced to co-operate with the this function.
