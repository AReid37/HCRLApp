GUIDELINES
* Avoid utilizing the '%' character within this log file.
* Use the following characters with caution as they also play a role in log decoding:
	Start of lines ::  [  >  -
	Within lines   ::  [  ]  (  )  -  :  ,  ;  ~

	Bypassing with character substitution syntax
	Works only in these sections: Added, Additional, Updated
		'&00' for '-'
		'&01' for ','
		'&02' for ':'
		'&11' for '('
		'&12' for ')'
		'&99' for '' (no character)

INFORMATION FOR EACH SECTION
	For the explanations below: described syntax elements marked with '*' are required
_____
[Version]
Syntax: [Version : {a.bb}*]
	{a.bb} : version number with 'a' as major number and 'bb' as minor number. 
	Ex. 1.0, 1.1, 1.11, 1.24
	Ex. [Version : 1.1]
_____
[Added] 
Header :: 
	Syntax: [Added : {ph},{sub}; {ph2},{sub2}]
	~~
	set placeholders (ph) and substitution phrase (sub) to replace them for easier logging
	{ph} : Placeholder key, a short string that will be replaced by a substitution phrase
	{sub} : Substitution phrase, the words to replace the placeholder key with
	Multiple ph/sub groups are separated with ';'
	Ex.	[Added : $f,Feather Bill; m>,Marshwood; #,x32]

Body :: 
	Syntax: ##|{InternalName}* - ({MainID}*; {RelatedIds})
	~~
	## : The entry number of added content ('1' for first, '2' second, '3' third...).
	{InternalName} : The in-game name given to the added item being described.
	{MainID} : Advised that only 'Item' data IDs may go here.
	{RelatedIds} : other related, non-wordy data Ids (tiles, projectiles, walls, ...).	
		Multiple of similar type --> (x21,22) or (x32~34); 
		Different types --> (x21 y22); 
	Ex. 9 |PotPie - (i42; t23 p44,52 w31~33)
		13|PiePan - (i40)
Note: If the data ID has numbers, it's best to create a legend key for it.
_____
[Additional]
Syntax1: > {Opt.Name} ({DataIDs}*) - {RelatedInternalName}* ({RelatedDataID}*)
Syntax2: > ({DataIDs}*) - {RelatedInternalName -or- Opt.Name}*
	{Opt.Name} : Custom name to describe the group of additional data Ids
	{DataIDs} : The additional Data IDs (of one type). Wordy data Ids added through here.
	{RelatedInternalName} : Internal name of item / content related to the data ids.
	{RelatedDataID} : The (item type) data ID of the related item / content.
	Ex1 > Watermelon Chunk (WaterMelonChunk) - Watermelon (i167)
		> (w54) - (i34)
		> (t33~35) - (i34)
	Ex2	> (t152,153) - Ambient Pineapple Huts 
Re-Note: If the data ID has numbers, it's best to create a legend key for it.
_____
[TTA]
Syntax: [TTA : #*]
	# : The total tally of items / contents added in this version (positive integers)
_____
[Updated]
Syntax: > {InternalName} ({RelatedDataID}*) - {ChangeDesc}*
	{InternalName} : The internal name of the item or content edited.
	{RelatedDataID} : The content / item that has been edited.
	{ChangeDesc} : A description of the changes made to the specified content.
	Ex. > PotPie (i42) - Crispier looking surface and creamier filling
		> PotPie (t23) - Changed texture to match new item design
_____
[Legend]
Syntax: {Key}* - {KeyDef}*
	{Key} : The key character used within version log
	{KeyDef} : A short description of what the key represents
Re-Note: If the data ID has numbers, it's best to create a legend key for it.
