GUIDELINES
* Avoid utilizing the '%' character within this log file.
* Use the following characters with caution as they also play a role in log decoding:
	Start of lines ::  [  >  -
	Within lines   ::  [  ]  (  )  -  :  ,  ;  ~

	Bypassing with character substitution syntax
	Works only in sections: Added, Additional, Updated
		'&00' for '-'
		'&01' for ','
		'&02' for ':'
		'&11' for '('
		'&12' for ')'
		'&99' for '' (no character)
