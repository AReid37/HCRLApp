[ADDITIONAL]

-- > Garlic Stem (d18) - GarlicClove (t46)  // Just changing the related data ID here
> Garlic Stem (d18) - GarlicClove (t47)
-- !open --
-- Let's add a new one but with a twist; it is the same as above but connected through a different id. 
> Garlic Stem (d18) - GarlicClove (t47)
	Post testing, this is the same as just adding another additional to the base content.
	The objectively realistic test should remove the old addit and add the new addit. Explains the changes above this omission block.
	Changing this additional also works for testing alternate matching by name for Net Change List, albeit indirectly
