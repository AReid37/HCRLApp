Logging Syntax v2

A new logging template with revised syntax for readability. 
Functionally similar to first, objectively less headache.

This file is only for describing the new log template syntax. 
Create a new file and follow the guidelines described below.

The original (legacy) syntax will remain functional but is highly advised against as it is considerably limited in capabilities and may be unpredictable at times. The new syntaxes are designed to be robust and efficient.

-- !open --
COMMENTING
* A single line log comment starts with '--'.
* A multiline log comment starts with '-- !open --' and ends with '-- !close --', each on a line of their own.

GUIDELINES
* The '%' character is not accepted within logs; any log lines containing this symbol will be skipped.
* Log decoding ends after every section has been identified and parsed.
* Each log has a line limit of 1250 lines. Smaller log batches are encouraged. 
* Use the following to bypass syntax-regulated characters in Added, Additional, or Updated sections:
		'&01' for ','
		'&03' for '~'
		'&99' for '' (no character)

SECTIONS AND NEW SYNTAX
* Each section is called by name on their own line, no additional parameters. They are to remain in the order by which they are explained below.
* Fully capitalized words are keywords for logger to decode. Avoid using all capitals within your log that would match any of the keywords.
* Each section must be preceeded and followed by an empty line.
* For the syntaxes and explanations below: elements marked with '*' are required.
* The following sections are not required for a complete log submission: Additional, Updated

USING LEGACY DECODER SYNTAX
* The logger will assume usage of the newer syntax (v2). Although advised against, the legacy syntax is still supported.
* To use the legacy decoder, the original syntax declaration "Version ([Version : a.bb])" must be at the top of the log. The syntax is automatically detected based on this.


_____
"Version": For identifying the version of this log. 
Syntax for Version Section:
L1  VERSION
L2a MAJOR {a}* MINOR {bb}*  
L2b {a}*.{bb}* 

L1 : Version section tag for identification. Must be the first section.
L2 : Version number declaration, two syntaxes for preference. 
	- 'a' is major number (0 or positive number).
	- 'bb' is minor number (0 to 99).
	NOTE: Entering either '1.1' or '1.01' registers as version '1.01'.

Example: 
	VERSION
	MAJOR 1 MINOR 21
	-- May also be written as '1.21'


-----
"Added": For all contents regarding this version of the log.
Syntax for Added Section:
L1  ADDED
LN  REPLACE {placeholder}* WITH {substitute}*
LX  {InternalName}* AS {DataIDs}*

L1 : Added section tag for identification.
LN : (Optional) Repeatable replacement lines that accept a placeholder phrase which is replaced with a given substitution phrase during log decoding.
	- {placeholder} the phrase to be replaced, cannot be plain numbers.
	- {substitute} the phrase to substitute with, cannot be plain numbers.
LX : Repeatable added content lines which adds the new content by internal name and identifies it as its data ids.
	- {InternalName} name of content being added, cannot be plain numbers and must not be the data ids.
	- {DataIDs} the data ids that identify this added content, cannot be plain numbers and must not be internal name.
	NOTE: You may use any {placeholders} defined earlier within either of the two parameters above. 
	NOTE FOR DATA IDS: Your data ID type must match with the items in the Legend section. Multiple ids are seperated by spaces, and groups of the same type can be condensed as 'x#,#' or 'x#~#'. Warning: Do NOT combine these grouping syntaxes (such as x#,#~#).
	NOTE FOR INTERNAL NAME: The logger will attempt to capitalize and space your internal content names. Using the '&99' before certain characters can be used to negate this effect.

Example:
	ADDED
	REPLACE m> WITH Marshwood
	REPLACE # WITH t32
	m> Chair		AS i345 #
	m> Lantern		AS i351 f10,26
	Feather Bill AS i890 t178,179 p60~62 p65,66
	N&99P&99CTres AS n2 npc_two


_____
"Additional": For any contents relating to contents of previous log versions.
Syntax for Additional Section:
L1  ADDITIONAL
LX  {DataIDs}* AS {OptName} TO {RelatedInternalName} BY {RelatedDataID}*

L1 : Additional section tag for identification.
LX : Repeatable additional content lines which adds the related to an existing content using mainly the related data ID.	
	- {DataIDs} the data ids relating to a previous content, cannot be plain numbers and must not be the related data id.
	- {OptName} an optional name for this group of additional content, cannot be related internal name or plain numbers.
	- {RelatedInternalName} the internal name of the existing object the data IDs are to be paired with, cannot be plain numbers and must match with related data ID provided.
	- {RelatedDataID} the single data ID which the additional data IDs are related, cannot be plain numbers.
	NOTE FOR DATA IDS: Your data ID type must match with the items in the Legend section. Multiple ids are seperated by spaces, and groups of the same type can be condensed as 'x#,#' or 'x#~#'. Warning: Do NOT combine these grouping syntaxes (such as x#,#~#).
	NOTE FOR OPTIONAL AND RELATED INTERNAL NAME: The logger will attempt to capitalize and space your internal content names. Using the '&99' before certain characters can be used to negate this effect.

Example: 
	ADDITIONAL
	WaterMelonChunk AS Watermelon Chunk TO Watermelon BY i167
	t46,47 AS TO Marshwood Lantern BY i351
	WaterMelonChunk2 BY i167

	NOTE: Keywords that don't have an arguement can be either included or omitted. Encouraged to include until having a good understanding of syntax.


_____
"TTA or TCA": The actual number of contents introduced in this version.
Syntax for Total Textures/Contents Added Section:
L1a TTA
L1b TCA
L2  {Texture/ContentCountNumber}*

L1 : Total Texture/Content count section tag for identification.
	 Using either "TTA" or "TCA" will count as identification for this tag.
L2 : The number of new contents that have been added through this version log.
	- {Texture/ContentCountNumber} can only be plain numbers and must be greater than 0.
		NOTE: This number is required as the logger will attempt to tally contents added for verification. It will be incorrect in instances such as referencing data IDs from previous versions which do not count towards the actual number of contents added in a version log.

Example:
	TCA
	22


_____
"Updated": The changes made to (previously) introduced contents
Syntax for Updated Section:
L1  UPDATED
LX  {RelatedName} BY {RelatedDataID}* WITH {ChangeDesc}*

L1 : Updated section tag for identification.
LX : Repeatable updated lines that identify the data ID and the related content name followed by a description of the changes made to that content
	- {RelatedName} the related (internal) name of the content being updated, cannot be plain numbers.
	- {RelatedDataID} the single data ID to which changes are being made, cannot be plain numbers.
	- {ChangeDesc} a description of the change(s) made to this piece of content.

	NOTE: You may create an updated entry for any content that was added in the same version as its update, although advised against (updates usually follow after the initial addition, just an ethical warning). The decoder will automatically detect and notify of this possibility, however there will be no impact on the outcome of your logging.

Example: 
	UPDATED
	PotPie BY i42 WITH Crispier looking surface and creamier filling
	PotPie BY t23 WITH Changed texture to match new item design
	t23 WITH Fixed an issue where parts of the texture were missing

	NOTE: Keywords that don't have an arguement can be either included or omitted. Encouraged to include until having a good understanding of syntax.

_____
"Legend": A list of the relavant symbols (for data IDs or miscellaneous information) used in this version log.
Syntax for Legend Section:
L1  LEGEND
LX  {Key}* AS {Definition}*

L1 : Legend section tag for identification.
LX : Repeatble legend lines of the symbol and the extended definition of the symbol that has been used within your log.
	- {Key} the short string of characters used within your log. Cannot be plain numbers or contain numbers.
	- {Definition} the extended description of which your legend Key represents. Cannot be plain number or contain numbers.
	NOTE FOR DEFINITION: When using the legend to shorthand content IDs (data IDs), the definition of legend key should match the phrase which is replaced by your legend key. For example, if the common prefix of a set of data IDs is "Tree_Tops_", your legend key may be "tt" and your definition could be either "Tree Tops" or "Tree_Tops_". This simplifies and gives use to the content integrity verification feature of the logger application.

	NOTE ON BEST USE FOR LEGEND: The legend keys are used to represent numbered contents with a common prefix. Take for example the phrase "Item_"; this phrase prefixes an ascending number of contents in Terraria. Instead of listing "Item_1, Item_2, Item_4" you can create a legend key and shorten this listing to "i1, i2, i4". It simplifies the logging process.
		- If it starts with a common phrase and ends with numbers, a legend entry may be ideal.
		- Best to use letters as keys for common content prefixes and use symbols as keys for miscellaneous things such as labelling specific contents (suffix).
		- The tilde symbol (~) may be troublesome to use as a legend key as it is already identified as a numeric range symbol in the log decoder. Not recommended for usage.

Example: 
	LEGEND
	i	AS Item
	t	AS Tiles
	tt AS Tree Tops
	* AS Introduced In Earlier Version


_____
"Summary": A section to summarize the additions and changes in this version log.
Syntax for Summary Section:
L1  SUMMARY
LX  AS {SummaryPart}*

L1 : Summary section tag for identification.
LX : Repeatable summary lines that summarize the additions or changes made in a version log.
	- {SummaryPart} a single line that describes (some of the) contents in a version log.

Example: 
	SUMMARY
	AS Brocolli, Cabbage, and few other green veggies, Veggie seeds (P1).
	AS Carrot, Pumpkins (pumpkin, squash), soil (and variants).
