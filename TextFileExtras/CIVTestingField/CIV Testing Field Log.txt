## [ CONTENT INTEGRATION VERIFICATION - TESTING LOG ] ##
Purpose:	This log will document any test cases and results of the CIV process as it browses through the folders and sub-folders for their *contents* and validates their existence. Test cases are organized in a step-by-step fashion to guide development of the CIV processing method.

Syntax
""""""
({Test Case Result: Yes/No or True/False})		{Test Case Description/Goal (as a yes or no question)}



Logs start
-----------------
	-> 'Content Validator' and its focused method 'Validate' herein referred to as 'CV'
	-> 'Content Integrity Verification' process referred to as 'CIV'
	-> 'ConValInfo' (Content Validator Info) struct used to store processing results referred to as 'InfoDock'
-----------------
(FALSE)		Text files or other type files for testing examples for CIV exist in example testing folder?
(FALSE)		Testing example files are respectively organized to the example version logs? 
(yes)		CV is capable of saving and loading all folder paths and file extensions it has been given as arguments?
(yes)		CV is capable of accessing given folder paths and listing all folders and subfolders within the given folder using Dbug tool?
(yes)		CV does not list any subfolders that are hidden or inaccessible?
(yes)		CV accesses library and expands the existing Data IDs within a given version range using the given legend?
(yes)		CV uses expanded Data IDs and checks for matching contents within the given folder and its subfolders in combination with the given file extensions?
(true)		CIV does not directly use an file writing or reading methods to validate library contents withing given folder(s)?
(yes)		CV does not match expanded Data IDs against content files that are hidden or inaccessible?
(yes)		CV logs Data ID matching part of the CIV process using Dbug tool?
(yes)		CV relays the results of each expanded Data ID checked for with InfoDock?
(yes)		At the end of CIV process, CV compiles the InfoDock and saves to the appropriate field or property?
(yes)		CV relays whether or not CIV was executed completely?
