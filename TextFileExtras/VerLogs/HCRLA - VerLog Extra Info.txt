 List of logs testing the latest log decoding syntax. Besides the first 3 tester logs, each log is intended to be small and efficient -- ~10 items added, and much less scattered around and about
	Log 0 - Ex1b: A translation of legacy Example Log 1 to latest syntax
	Log 1 - Full error-testing kit for every section and scenario
	Log 2 - Testing section preferences
	Log 3 - Ex1: Straight log, no addits or updates
	Log 4 - Ex2: Updated and Addits, includes self-updating, and suffix legends
	Log 5 - Ex3: Regular log but with odd data IDs (wordy IDs)
	Log 6 - Ex4: Regular with focus on short-hand or alternate syntaxes

 Keeping tabs on the data IDs being used in example logs; sequential, as it should be.

Example 1 & 2 Version Log
	PURPOSE
		These verion log examples tests for the regular function of the Log Decoder with the correct information entered within version log sections. Very little or no garbage data; looking for ideal, flawless function.
	TESTING OBJECTIVES
	. Correct detection of sections of the version log, and identifying when there is no data for those sections
	. VERSION specifics
		- A number in the format 'a.bb' exists
	. ADDED specifics
		- [1] Key substitution within lines of added content
		- [2] No key substitution within lines of added content
		- Identification of content names and their related data ids
		- Content names are checked to be spaced and capitalized ('ItemZero' becomes 'Item Zero'; 'Item two' becomes 'Item Two')
	. ADDITIONAL specifics
		- Identification of additional content within their lines, and the added contents they relate to
		- Content names and optional names are checked to be spaced (not to be mistook with non-(alpha)numeric data Ids)
	. TTA specifics
		- A number exists within tag
	. UPDATED
		- [1] Detection of no data
		- [2] Identification of updated content and their related content
	. LEGEND
		- Identification of legend key and definitions
	. SUMMARY
		- Identification and partitioning of summary parts



----------
Example 3 Version Log
	PURPOSE ::
		Tests the log decoder against multitudes of incorrect or garbage data, then to reassess and develop the decoder to resolve the issues that arise.
		- Test for null, blank, incorrect, and garbage data
		-  
	TESTING OBJECTIVES
	- Try to break anything and everything




-----------
Further Example Version Logs (4+)
	PURPOSE :: 
		Additional, proper version log data for testing the HCRLA program functions (similar to Examples 1 & 2)
