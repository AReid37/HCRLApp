	2nd test

The dependencies between sections: 
	- Version (V) first
	- Added (A) and Additional (D) before: TTA/TTC (T), Updated (U), Legend (L)
	- Updated (U) before: Legend (L)
	- TTA/TTC (T) before: Summary (S)

The available orders of sections that should not break the decoder
	- V A D T U L S    [default]	[DEFINITELY WORKS]
	- V A D T S U L					[WORKS]
	- V A D T U S L					[WORKS]
	- V A D U L T S					[WORKS]
	- V A D U T S L					[WORKS]
	- V A D U T L S					[WORKS]
	- V D A ...						[WORKS* - has a cost: noted in revised template v2]

The default organization of sections definitely works, so it won't be necessary in these tests
