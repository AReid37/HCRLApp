	I counted 69 data IDs, original says there are 70, verification says there's 67  ... oh boi
	This issue has been figured out above: a grouping syntax error x#,#~#

	Recounting all the data IDs above: 26 + 23 + 12 + 8 = 69
	Okay, so I think the legacy decoder also counted IDs incorrectly. We shall see in other tests
